PHP Learning Notes No.1

1.0 Introductory:

I first learned php when I was a fresh girl in the university. I started a progamme with my friends and we need achieve remote login in. And 
I chose PHP as dynamic interactive language. And before that, I learned HTML and CSS in summer hoilday. On April in 2016, I wrote web pages for
my college with my partners. And we were encouraged. Now I am going to start my thrid year in university. I finish my final exam. I think it is
a good chance to review php. And I will write down some notes in the process.

1.1 Build Operating Environment

I had built operating environment for php when i first learned php. Because I refreshed operating system in the computer, I lost the operating 
system in my computer.
PHP is a language which used in the back of the database and the website. You must set HTTP protocol and also need to set MySQL. 
I recommand AppServ package to set up your operating system. It is very helpful to set up the paths of Apache MySQL PHP. If you download the
three packages seperately, you need to set paths through control panel.

This is the first step of starting php program.
